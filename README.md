# 🧾 Problem Statement

Micro-businesses, small traders, freelancers, and gig workers form the backbone of the economy, yet a large percentage of them operate outside formal tax and compliance frameworks.

This is not due to unwillingness, but because of:
- Fear of penalties and legal consequences
- Complex and frequently changing tax laws
- Manual, time-consuming paperwork
- Heavy dependence on accountants or intermediaries
- Poor understanding of filing timelines and obligations

As a result, many micro-businesses remain informal, limiting their ability to access credit, scale operations, participate in government schemes, and build long-term financial credibility.

There is a critical need for a **real-time, intelligent compliance assistant** that simplifies tax and regulatory obligations, guides users proactively, and removes fear from the compliance process.
